Let's be real, tofu on its own is the not most exciting thing. Recently however, we made a recipe where the tofu was really good! Let me share it with you.


The recipe we made was a [Sweet and Sour Tofu Stir Fry](https://www.pickuplimes.com/single-post/sweet-and-sour-tofu-stir-fry). I wasn't a big fan of the recipe itself. Partially because I'm not a big fan of sweet dishes and partially because we might have made it a bit too sour.

But. The tofu chunks on their own were delicious. It was actually quite a shame that you had to mix them into the sweet and sour sauce which  completely overwhelmed them. If you would use these chunks in a stir fry, or on the side of some Asian style dishes, it would work like a charm.

The result.

## Recipe

Based on the instructions of [Sadia Badiei](https://www.pickuplimes.com/single-post/sweet-and-sour-tofu-stir-fry):

1. Cut the tofu in 1 cm cubes and press as much moisture out of them as possible using paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. Reducing the moisture will help speed up the browning process, since there is less moisture to evaporate before the [Maillard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction) reaction can take place. Also it will prevent sticking while cooking.
1. To a large shallow bowl, add the:
    - 450 g, 1 cm cubed tofu
    - 30 ml (2 tbsp) sodium reduced soy sauce

    and gently toss to coat. Then add the:
    - 30 g (1/4 cup) cornstarch,
    - 1/2 tsp salt,
    - 1/4 tsp pepper.

    Gently stir until all the pieces are well coated.

2. Heat a large pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add the oil and the tofu. Cook the tofu until it's crispy and golden on all sides (~10 minutes). Don't disturb the tofu too much while it's cooking, otherwise, it might crumble. Only stir it every couple of minutes.
