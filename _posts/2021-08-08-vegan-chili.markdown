Easy, tasty, vegan, cheap, leftovers. A simplified and *Europeanized* version of [The Best Vegetarian Chili](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-vegetarian-bean-chili) from [The Food Lab](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24861842-the-food-lab) by J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt.

We left out the home made chili paste, because these chili's are hard to find in Europe. If you can find them, go ahead and use them, but the taste is already great with the marmite/soysause + chipotle chilis!

4. Add chickpea/tomato/bean mixture and add chickpea/bean liquid as required to get the right consistency. Simmer for at least 30 minutes, ideally 1.5 hrs, the longer the better! Stir every now and then so the bottom doesnâ€™t burn. Season to taste with salt if needed.
