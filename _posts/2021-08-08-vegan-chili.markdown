Put the chickpeas in a big bowl or pot with a flat base and mash with a potato masher until almost all of the chickpeas are broken. Add the 2 cans of tomatoes and mash until the tomatoes are broken. Drain the 2 cans of beans reserving the liquid. Add beans to the chickpea/tomato bowl. Add the 2 tablespoons of chipotle chilis to the bowl.

4. Add chickpea/tomato/bean mixture and add chickpea/bean liquid as required to get the right consistency. Simmer for at least 30 minutes, ideally 1.5 hrs, the longer the better! Stir every now and then so the bottom doesn’t burn. Season to taste with salt.
