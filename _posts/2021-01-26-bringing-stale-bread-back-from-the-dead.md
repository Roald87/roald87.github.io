Not many things can beat the taste and smell of a freshly baked bread. Unfortunately this fresh-bake taste quickly disappears and the texture becomes worse with time. After day two, the bread is nothing like it was when you bought it. Luckily you can bring it back to (almost) its new state with a simple trick!

## Intro

Recently it happened to me that a loaf of bread was laying around for 5 days and it became quite stale. Then I remembered this great life hack on how to revive bread. Just make it wet and pop it in the oven. The results are quite amazing. Plus your kitchen smells pretty good afterwards!

Top tip: you can also use this trick to impress your guests with a seemingly freshly baked bread in the morning. üëç

## Recipe

1. Preheat the oven to 200 ¬∞C (390 ¬∞F). In case you have a fancy steam oven, you can also use that setting and skip the next step. Although for very stale breads it would probably be beneficial to moisturize it.
2. Wet the bread while holding it underneath the water tap. The staler it is, the more water you should let it soak up.
3. Put it in the oven for 5-15 minutes, depending on how wet you made it. Once the crust is crispy again you can take it out.
4. Let is cool down if you have the patience. If you don't, like most of us in the real world, start feasting on your awesome revitalized bread!
