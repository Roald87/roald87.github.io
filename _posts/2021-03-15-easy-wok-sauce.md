2. Heat a wok, carbon steel or any pan without a non-stick coating over high heat until it is hot. Don't use a pan with a non-stick coating since they can't handle these high temperatures. You might want to open a window and put the ventilation on high ðŸ”¥.

3. Add a few tablespoons of vegetable oil to the hot pan which should start to smoke a little. Then add the bag of

   - 400 g pre-cut Asian vegetables

4. Keep stirring constantly, while the heat remains on high. If it starts to smoke heavily, lower the heat slightly.

5. After a few minutes the vegetables will start to turn soft. Then add the wok sauce and lower the temperature to medium-high.

6. Cook the mixture for another minute or so. If the veggies released little water and you do not see a sauce forming, add a few table spoons of water to create a sauce.
