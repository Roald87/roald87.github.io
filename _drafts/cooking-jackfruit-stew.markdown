Made with two cans of jackfruit, dried them. Fried some some time, medium success. Didn't really brown. Added red wine to scrape off the bits on the bottom pan.

Simultaneously made mirepoix, at the end added some tomato paste, garlic, chiliflakes, marmite, soysauce. THen added this mixture to the wine/jackfruit stuff.

Added some water to the whole mix and a bay leaf. Then let it simmer for an hour.

Was really good (8/10). One improvement for next time. Use potato masher (?) to get the jackfruit pieces into smaller ones. The bigger ones unfortunately didn't absorb the taste very well.

Ate it with mashed potatoes.
