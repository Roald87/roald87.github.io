:wave: I'm Roald. From :netherlands: and working in :switzerland: at [inspire AG](https://www.inspire.ethz.ch/) where I program robotic arms. Before that I worked at [Flisom](https://flisom.com/) on flexible solar panels.

In my spare time I like to cook, program and keep up with the latest developments in renewable energy, physics and astronomy.

On this blog I'll post about any of the above subjects or whatever keeps my mind busy at the time.

I also have a second blog (in Dutch) [roaldin.ch](https://roaldin.ch), where I blog about daily live in Switzerland from a Dutch perspective.
