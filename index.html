    <div class="post"><p>Keeping track of all the things that are happening on your machine can be a daunting task, whether it’s expected events or unexpected warnings and errors that you want to inform the user of. Luckily, Beckhoff provides us with a tool that can help with that: namely, the EventLogger. In this article, I will introduce the PLC part of the EventLogger and show some useful features (code: <a href="https://github.com/Roald87/TwincatTutorials/tree/main/TwinCatEventLogger/PlcPart">PlcPart</a>). A <a href="https://roald87.github.io/twincat/2021/01/20/twincat-eventlogger-hmi-part.html">second article</a> will show how to visualize the events using TwinCAT’s web-based HMI (TE2000) (code: <a href="https://github.com/Roald87/TwincatTutorials/tree/main/TwinCatEventLogger/HmiPart">HmiPart</a>).</p>

    <div class="post"><p>During the first Corona wave in March-April 2020, I noticed that there was very little cloud cover in Switzerland and the Netherlands. Then, I remembered this <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/418601a">article</a> where they saw similar effects after 9/11. So, I collected weather data and crunched the numbers to see if it was just me or if it really was sunnier than usual.</p>

    <div class="post"><p>In this article, I want to highlight a useful and fairly new TwinCAT feature: Stand-alone PLC projects. As usual, Beckhoff’s InfoSys provides a good explanation of how to set up and run such a project from scratch. However, there is little information on why the separation might be a good idea, how to separate an existing project, and some of the pitfalls you might encounter.</p>
